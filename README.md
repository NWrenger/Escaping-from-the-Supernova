# Escaping from the Supernova

This is my first program/textadventure coded in rust. It's in english. Have fun!

## Features
- 16 Endings in total
- Procedural Generation with Seed System
- An astonishing Story

## To Do
- English language Support :white_check_mark:
- Seed System :white_check_mark:
- Story Writing/Implementing :white_check_mark:
- Refactor, so rewriting the code base for major improvements in the structure of the project :white_check_mark:

## What's next?
I don't know. After my refactor, it's way easier adding new content. So, stay tuned!
